## üîÑ How Everything Works Together

1. **User visits your website** ‚Üí `Views/Home/Index.cshtml` shows the landing page
2. **User clicks "Get Started"** ‚Üí `Views/Auth/Register.cshtml` shows registration form
3. **User fills out form** ‚Üí `Controllers/AuthController.cs` processes the registration
4. **User data is saved** ‚Üí `Models/ApplicationUser.cs` stores user information in database
5. **User logs in** ‚Üí `Services/JwtService.cs` creates secure authentication token
6. **User sees dashboard** ‚Üí `Views/Dashboard/Index.cshtml` shows investment overview
7. **User connects bank** ‚Üí `Controllers/PlaidController.cs` handles Plaid integration
8. **Financial data flows** ‚Üí `Models/PlaidModels.cs` stores account and transaction data
9. **User sees analysis** ‚Üí `Services/GRPVService.cs` performs investment calculations
10. **User interacts socially** ‚Üí `Controllers/SocialController.cs` manages friends and messages

This architecture separates concerns clearly:
- **Controllers** handle user requests
- **Services** contain business logic
- **Models** define data structure
- **Views** display information
- **React components** provide modern interactivity

Each file has a specific purpose, making the code easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
